P170
Taking a hold of and hurling the glowing red potion, the shadow rescinds it’s grasp an Twilight is freed.

“Thank goodness Trixie saved you Twi-“ Trixie’s words cease as Twilight silences her with a peck on her lips.

“Uhh… T-Twilight, Trixie doesn’t… she’s not… you kn-HEY!”

Not paying any attention, Twilight knocks Trixie over and clambers after her as the azure mare attempts to crawl away. Totally infatuated with her ‘friend’, Twilight continues to pour her cheery affection on and keeps Trixie stuck down. They say love is strong, maybe a little too strong in this case. Unable to move, Trixie is trapped by Twilight forever.
