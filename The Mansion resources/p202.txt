P202
Upon closer inspection of a chart lay beside the device, there appear to be large, familiarly shaped stars in the constellations above. Checking back and forth, Trixie can’t see them for the life of her, these stars HUGE and clearly unmissable.

As Trixie takes the chart and turns away, allowing the moonlight to fall on it better as she continues to examine it. It is only at this point do these missing stars become apparent. As Trixie peers into the expansive night sky, a twisted, hungry magical device begins to collect the end of Trixie’s snout to finally complete the chart’s constellations.
