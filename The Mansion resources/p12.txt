The very tip of their horns aglow, Twilight is still shaking her head as she recovers from the sensation of being forced through a pipe.

“I… I hope that’s not something that’s regular around here,” she whispers in the dead silence.

Returning her whimpering with no response, Trixie winces her left eye as she notices the glow of her friend’s light a little brighter and closer than it should really be. Pausing, she glares to her side as she notices Twilight getting closer to her, cowering as she peers forth into the darkness.

“What’s wrong?” Twilight queries blankly.

“Personal space. Trixie needs it.”

Giving a huff, Twilight takes a marked step away from the blue pony and throws her hoof out, giving Trixie clearance to move on as they press further into the dungeon. Ahead on the right, the girls find a lone door.
