P1
Deep in the Everfree Forest, Trixie sleeps peacefully in the caravan, foolishly parked in the middle of one of the most dangerous glades on the face of Equestria. A howling wind awakes her all of a sudden, and she gasps to see her hat and cape floating out of the open hatch in her caravan.

Immediately she lunges out, giving chase through the forest as her garments mysteriously continue to withdraw away from her, retreating deeper and deeper until finally she reaches a clearing in the trees. A looming shadow comes across her and Trixie quakes on the spot in the intimidating presence of a large, gargantuan manor house.

Biting her lip, she spots her hat and cape floating away inside through the front door. Knowing that she must retrieve her valuables back, she nudges the blue gates open and dares to intrude.
