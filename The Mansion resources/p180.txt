P180
Choosing to rest, the girls lay down on the hard marble floor and close their eyes. Trixie falls fast sleep immediately, but Twilight is bothered by something, something that would make it so much easier to just rest and fall asleep on. Something that every other room has had except… this one

It bothers her so much that she can’t sleep, but it doesn’t take her long to notice what it is she has been thinking of as she looks back on herself to find her tail slithering across the floor, her flanks flattening to join it.
