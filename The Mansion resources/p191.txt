The girls trot over to the graveyard and enter through the jagged black railings. As Twilight trots too daringly close to one of the dirt mounds, a blackened claw bursts out of it and grabs at her. She recoils and screams, backing up into another dirt mound with another undead creature grasping at her from behind. The claws continue to appear and grasping at Twilight, pulling her deeper into the shallow graves as Trixie watches on.
