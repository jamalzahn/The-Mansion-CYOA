P116
Gazing into the mirror, Trixie could have sworn that her reflection seems to be even a little bit delayed. She tests it in various ways, making silly faces, dancing about, even knocking on the glass itself. At this moment, when her hooves connect with her reflections’, she feels something take a hold of them, suddenly being pulled violently into the mirror.
