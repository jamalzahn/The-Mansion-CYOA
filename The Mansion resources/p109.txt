P109
Slipping into the room, Trixie finds a small table to be the only thing present… and a strange looking doll sitting on it. Upon closer inspection, the doll appears to be of her, and as she realises what cruel manner of magic may be about to befall her, a black tentacle hanging from the ceiling that had been following her throughout the dungeon suddenly plucks a single hair from her lustrous silver mane, and whisks it over to the doll.

As Trixie turns to flee, a needle withdraws from another dark tendril and plunges into the heart of the doll. Trixie tumbles to the ground and shivers, her entire body completely paralyzed.
