P171
Trixie grabs the blue potion in her mouth and flings it at Twilight. The shadows do not even get hit by it but withdraws at speed, knowing full well what it is coming. The phial shatters harmlessly against Twilight, now lay on the floor, the blue liquid spilling across her.

“Well that was lucky, are you okay Twilight?” Trixie queries.

Twilight does not respond though, for a minute she stares at the floor, mumbling and gurgling to herself. Trixie’s ears lower as she is afraid to know what is happening, approaching, Twilight looks up and Trixie reels back, seeing her cheeks tainted an odd blue colour and puffed up. Soon, this effect begins to spread across her body, Trixie stepping back, even falling over in confusion, as Twilight’s body begins to balloon, filling with whatever was in that blue potion.

Twilight won’t be going anywhere for a while.
