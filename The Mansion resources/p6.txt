The bubbling pit gurgles and refuses to put up with this manner of intimidation any longer, spitting Twilight out like a piece of gum before evaporating, leaving the room clean and untouched.

Still looking desperately up at her saviour a moment passes between the two girls as Trixie looks on, unsure of how to go about being the hero (for once). Her role becomes clearer as Twilight leaps from the floor into a close embrace with the showpony.

“Thank you Trixie, without you, it would have gotten me for sure.” Twilight shudders at the thought.

“Y-yeah, no problem, w-what’re f-f-friends for, right?” Tilting her head, Twilight seems perplexed that Trixie refers to their relationship as being friends, especially in regards to what has happened previously.

“Absolutely. Though anyway I should ask you, what’re you doing in this place?” Twilight enquires, sitting unusually close to Trixie for comfort.

“Well… some evil shadow monster stole Trixie’s hat and cape, and she MUST get them back. A better question though is what are you doing here?”

“Oh… well… I,” Twilight stumbles, unable to answer.

“Nevermind, Trixie doesn’t care, let’s just get out of here. Oh, and let’s get my hat and cape back before we leave.” Raising an eyebrow at Trixie returning to her usual self, Twilight stands and sides herself by the blue mare to face the room as the two choose their next course of action.
