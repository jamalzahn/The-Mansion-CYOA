P68
Choosing the clearly logical option, Trixie heads to leave through one of the four doors surrounding her. Upon reaching for the handle, the door sinks into the floor, disappearing. The same occurs with each of the others as she gallops to each to try and escape, turning to the pedestal as her last and only option. Deciding to examine it, the plinth rapidly  descends into the wooden floor and dissolves, taking the object with it.

Trixie waits for a moment for something to happen, but nothing does. Minutes turn into hours as she continues to wait, banging on the walls and floor, crying for help, but nopony and nothing responds.

After a countless amount of time expending energy panicking, Trixie collapses, barely conscious, when finally the room responds, quite unfavourably Trixie finds, as the four walls begin grinding inwards, the square space slowly shrinking. Trixie pulls herself to her hooves and is forced upright as she is crumpled into a cubic prison when the walls halt.

Trixie’s eyes fill with tears as she remains trapped forever.
