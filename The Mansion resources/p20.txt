P20
As Trixie trots away from the desk, Twilight’s whinny’s of delight turn into horrified screaming a little further down the library hall. Running to assist, Trixie can’t believe her eyes as she finds a book assailing her friend. Sat open on the floor, purple rivers pour into it as they attempt to suck Twilight in and trap her there forever.
