As Trixie reaches out to touch one of the fragile sides of the pyramid, it explodes with a flash of blinding light, both of the mares throwing a hoof over their eyes as they reel back. With their vision slowly readjusting, Twilight gasps as the two now find themselves in a completely different room. The ceiling reaches high and circles around them down to the floor in a dome shape, everything white and powerfully bright. Looking down, they appear to be standing in the centre of a large hall, in the centre on a larger blue plinth that is surrounded by a small river of sorts.

Twilight’s ears give a twitch as she notices a gentle sound on the air. Turning, the girls find a golden harp, unusually playing itself a soft, enticing melody.
