P32
Trixie dashes straight ahead and through into the next room, the shadows wind through the halls and follow closely as she flees farther into the gallery. She shuts the door behind herself, somehow expecting it to keep the monster following at bay, and heads for the exit.

Every single one of the paintings on the walls flicker and change, their inhabitants taking on more grim expressions, some having their faces twisted into unreal aberrations. They leap from their hangers and gather at the door, barring Trixie’s escape. She gallops to the way she came in but sees it slowly being overcome by darkness.

Trixie’s only choice now is how she will be caught, furious darkness, or consumed by paintings.
