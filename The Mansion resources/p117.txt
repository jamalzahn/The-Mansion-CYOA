P117
Entering the left door, the girls walk into a theatre, Trixie leaps up onto the stage and begins to pretend to perform as Twilight looks on giggling. Things begin to go awry as wooden planks drop from the ceiling attached to shadow strands and Twilight waves her hooves about to warn Trixie.

Not taking any notice, Trixie continues to flaunt her entertainment as the dark threads wander down and wrap themselves around her hooves, taking hold of her, and lurching her into the air.

Twilight must act quickly.
