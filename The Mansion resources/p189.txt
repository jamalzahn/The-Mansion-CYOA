P189
Trixie grits her teeth and shoves Twilight away from her, galloping frantically for the exit.

Not expecting it, Twilight’s legs give way and she collapses, trying to get up and call after Trixie is immediately prevented as black tentacles lash from the floor and encompass her body again.

Trixie isn’t stupid though, and is able to see through as clear a deception as that.

Effortlessly, she trots through the calm foyer, out through the front door and down the paved path. Trixie waits until she’s a good distance away before stopping to smirk back at the house, content with herself for outsmarting the monster.

A quick chill ripples down her spine as the sound of a distant pony crying out for mercy resounds all around, the trees of the forest joining in with the sad moans and whines.

Come to think of it, it might not have hurt to give the Twilight a chance. Trixie had already proven she could outrun the shadow, and the exit was right there.

Maybe she should have too, because a certain lavender unicorn did in fact wander foolishly in a certain evil mansion and get trapped there.

As the thought crosses Trixie’s mind, she turns to see dark vines lassoing the front door, the windows, and finally the entire building.

Oh well, at least Trixie got out.
