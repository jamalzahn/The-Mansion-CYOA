“What’re you doing? HELP ME!” Twilight waggles her front hooves uselessly, the book chomping a few more inches out of her body.

Without a word, Trixie shoves the bookmark between the pages and grasps at Twilight’s hooves, smirking. What a stupid idea, why did you pick this option?

“AAH!” Twilight suddenly flies forth, the book completely relinquishing its grasp on her, tumbling to the library floor with Trixie as the magic from the tome dissipates into the air.

Oh… well, good choice!
