Trixie directs her hoof to the phial of fluid, her leg raises itself with a mind of its own and she immediately downs a bit of it.

Lurching over slightly, Trixie doesn’t feel good as an odd feeling of toxicity ripples throughout her body. The moment the sensation stretches to the very last part of her being, she finds herself down on the ground, gazing up into a much larger room, suddenly the size of an ant.

Looking up at the table, Trixie can only guess what the cake might do for her, if only she could reach it.

You have chosen, poorly.
