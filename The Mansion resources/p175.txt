P175
As Twilight turns away, Trixie procures a key. As she raises her hoof to insert it into the lock, it suddenly bites down on it! Trixie lunges backwards in horror, bumping into Twilight, as the features and frames of the door begin to bend and emit sawdust as they move and rearrange themselves. Before long, something resembling a face becomes clear, it’s mouth spitting out a few pieces of gold as it hacks and coughs up a cloud of wood shavings.

“What’s the big idea? Some of us are trying to sleep you featherbrains!”

“Excuse me, featherbrain?”

“Come on Trixie let’s just l-leave it alone” Twilight whimpers.

“Yeah, get out of here and go you little cretins.”

“Trixie will NOT stand for insults from the likes of some ancient hunk of wood”

“Ancient hunk of wood? Come over here and I’ll show you just what an ancient hunk of wood can do!”

Before Trixie can descend any further into a fight with a door, Twilight grabs Trixie’s tail with her mouth and begins to drag her away as they continue to exchange insults all the way down the hall.

Despite her rash actions, at least Trixie managed to sweep up those couple of gold bits that nasty little door spat out back there.
