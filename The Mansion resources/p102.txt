P102
Despite Twilight’s warning, Trixie carries on walking. To try and save her, Twilight tries to tug her back with magic. An ensuing petty battle causes the floor to cave in and take both mares with it.

As the girls recover from their harsh landing, Twilight screams and leaps into Trixie’s arms

“SNAKES!!”

“Oh do not tell Trixie you are afra-OUCH!” As Trixie ‘consoles’ Twilight’s fear, one of the hundreds of writhing reptiles in the pit latches onto her hoof and sinks it’s teeth in, filling her blood with venom. Twilight attempts to care for her as Trixie becomes dizzy, only to be bitten herself.

The mares soon find out, however, that this is no ordinary venom.
