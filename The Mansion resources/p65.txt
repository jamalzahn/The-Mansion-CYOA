P65
Trixie directs her hoof to the tiny cake, her leg raises itself with a mind of its own and she immediately swallows it whole.

Grinning like a silly filly, Trixie lets out a moan of approval as a warm, seductive feeling passes over her. Her brief heavenly escape is interrupted when she notices her raised hoof throbbing. Fear takes hold as her entire body begins to bloat and inflate, swelling her five, then six, then seven times her normal size.

In her panicked state, as the room bends but refuses to give way to her enormous size, Trixie thrashes and smashes vial on the table. The tiny dosage spills onto some indiscernible portion of her skin and suddenly, she shrinks to her normal size again.

Giving herself a rapid once over, Trixie decides all is as well as can be for now, and presses on through one of the two exits.
