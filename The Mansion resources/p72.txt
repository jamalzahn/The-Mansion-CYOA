P72
Entering into a library, Trixie is taken aback at the sheer size of the room. Trixie doesn’t find it out of the question that every type of magic might be covered in this collection, and also possibly might contain every spell within each category. A twinge of greed raises the corner of her mouth as her heart flutters at her next thought.

There might even be enough knowledge here to outdo Twilight Sparkle herself.

Common sense doesn’t yet escape Trixie, as she dares not to remove or even touch any of the books on the shelves, but that doesn’t matter, as she spies on one of the many opulent desks an open book, lay there waiting for somepony to read it.
