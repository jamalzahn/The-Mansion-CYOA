P22
Grasping Twilight’s hooves tight, Trixie gives a tug, and another, and another. Her efforts seem completely in vain as Twilight is drawn further and deeper into the book until eventually only her hooves stick out.

In a last ditch attempt, Trixie tries to let go of Twilight to save herself, but as the book swallows her friend whole, it chomps onto Trixie’s own blue hooves. The purple ether refuses to give up as it washes more and more of her body into its bound pages, and as she loses her face, her head, and finally her chest, her grip on the floor slips and the tome completely consumes her.

A book about ponies, now there’s a novel idea.
