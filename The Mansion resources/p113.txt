Trixie chooses to inspect the ornate grandfather clock behind the stairs. She notices, upon closer viewing, that the clock hands seem to be ticking backwards. As though it were waiting for her, the clock hands begin to rapidly sweep by minutes and hours in reverse.

To Trixie, the clock seems to be getting farther away and much, much taller. She is concerned only briefly at this before her adult mind seems to disintegrate, and she feels the much bigger urge to jump and leap about as the cutie marks on her tiny flanks disappear. She doesn’t care about cutie marks right now though, she’s having too much fun!

A presence allows her to find her bumbling way into a room laden with toys, a childs heaven! Trixie may never want to grow up again!
