Heading over to the now giant cake on the floor, Trixie breaks a crumb off and commands Twilight to take a bite out of it.

“It’ll work, it has to!”

“Trixie… I don’t know,” Twilight mumbles. But against her will, Trixie shoves the piece into her mouth and forces her to chomp on it whilst she herself takes a bite out of it.

“See Twilight I told you s-“ As  the girls return to normal size, they may have wanted to take a couple of steps back from one another before growing, as Trixie stops in shock a she feels Twilight’s snout press firmly yet softly against her own.

“Ah, let’s uh, let’s carry on, shall we?”
