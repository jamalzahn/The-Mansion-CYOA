Trixie and Twilight press on through the forward facing door, entering into a hallway with a change. The ceiling stretches high into the infinite rafters of the building whilst odd paintings line the walls, scorched and ripped as though something terrible found its home on their canvases and somepony did not want anypony else to see.
