Trixie traverses another corridor, finally entering into another plain room with two exits, one to her front and one to her right as well as a table on the left.

A peculiar force encourages Trixie to peruse the table, leading her to discover a tiny bottle of green, bubbling liquid and a small slice of deliciously appealing cake resting on it.

Trixie doesn’t want to, but she can’t help herself, as she reaches out to the table, she cannot pull away, but retains enough control to direct her hoof.
