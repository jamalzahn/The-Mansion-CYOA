Leaping back and righting herself, she faces the direction she had just come from. For now the presence has seemingly decided to return to its passive nature, though the door back into the foyer is now covered in the same onyx fire that she had seen before.

Given no other option, Trixie presses on deeper into the mansion, gently opening the door at the other end of the hallway.
