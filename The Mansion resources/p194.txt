P194
Entering into a new, darker room, the girls find a doll resembling Trixie on a table. At first Twilight picks it up and begins to play around with it, giggling as she mimics Trixie and makes fun of her. Trixie does not take kindly to the gesture at all and grasps the doll with her magic. An overwhelming feeling of possession coming over her, Twilight too magically tugs on the doll, a war ensues.
