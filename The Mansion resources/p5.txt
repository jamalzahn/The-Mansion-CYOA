Without hesitation, Trixie dives into the pools of ooze and grasps at Twilight’s free front hooves.

“T-Trixie, please help me!” Twilight squeals as her mouth is freed.

“Trixie IS helping you! KICK HARDER!”

Trixie’s horn explodes with a flash of pink, wrapping its ethereal field around the girls’ hooves as she pulls with all of her might.

A smaller tentacle lashes forth from one of the many dark vines encasing Twilight, bruising Trixie’s skin and finding its way around her body. As Trixie withstands the assault, one particularly intrusive tendril discovers the items Trixie had not long ago alleviated from the table in the foyer and decides to retrieve it from her.
