P34
With tentacles of darkness hot on her hooves, Trixie jumps into the central room and bars the door with her body as they pound furiously. Her horn glows she does her best to fortify the door, too tired to physically carry on with even a brief respite, and it hopes it is enough to hold.

The banging ceases completely all of a sudden, however Trixie doesn’t buy the calm for a moment and keeps herself against the door, teeth clenched. The shadow has indeed halted its relentless assault, aware that Trixie is entirely capable of outrunning it, and so decides to try a new approach.

Still pinned back, Trixie frowns, waiting for the door to explode about her when a bubbling puddle of black goo fountains up from the centre of the floor in front of her. She watches it intently as a blue haired, lavender unicorn is strung out from the seething mass, held by a web of sedate black tar.

Twilight lays with her eyes closed tightly, shaking on the spot as she mumbles quietly to herself.

“Trixie… please… save me.”
