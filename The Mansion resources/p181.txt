P181
Twilight bounds excitedly up to the telescope and begins to use it as Trixie simply stands by and watches. Noticing a small paper chart on the floor beside the device, Trixie nudges Twilight and shows it to her.

Upon closer inspection, there appear to be large, familiarly shaped stars in the constellations above. Checking back and forth, the girls can’t see them for the life of them, these stars HUGE and clearly unmissable.

Twilight takes the chart and turns away, allowing the moonlight to fall on it better as she continues to examine it. It is only at this point do these missing stars become apparent, as Twilight turns back around to find Trixie gone.

Something new has appeared up above though, and as Twilight peers into the expansive night sky, a twisted, hungry magical device begins to collect the end of Twilight’s snout to finally complete the chart’s constellations.
