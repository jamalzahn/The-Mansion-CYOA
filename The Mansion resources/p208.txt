P208
Trixie sees the faint, eye-catching glimmer of a mysterious golden bottle half-buried in the mountain of gold.

Before she knows it, Trixie finds herself tossed into the air, and as her vision returns to her, she looks down in terror to find her body dribbling down and into the spout of the lamp, now resting amongst the gold once more, a place that Trixie will now become familiar with for a very, very long time.
